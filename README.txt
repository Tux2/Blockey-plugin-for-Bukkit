Before starting the server, put the Blockey.jar in the plugin folder of your bukkit server.
All players need to execute the command /blockey in game to be registered as a player. A second time /blockey will unregister the player.
When a player is registered and picks up a slime ball, he will get a message "you are now the carrier". He can no longer move (only jump).
After 10 seconds the slime ball is automatically dropped (if not yet by the player).A message is sent to the player to notice him.
